1. Business level constraints (time, human, fiscal and other resources, stakeholders) trump technical constraints every time. Identifying these should be step zero in any design process.
2. A business-level risk model assists with appropriate design with respect to both security and availability and should ultimately drive component selection.
3. Content seems very much focused on public IP services provided through multiple networked subsystems. While this is a very popular category of modern systems design, not all systems fall in to this category (eg. embedded), and even if they do many complex systems are internal, and public-facing interfaces are partly shielded/outsourced (Cloudflare, AWS, etc.).
4. Existing depth in areas such as database replication could perhaps be grouped in a generic fashion as examples of fault tolerance and failure / issue-mitigation strategies.
5. Asynchronicity and communication could be grouped together under architectural paradigms (eg. state, consistency and recovery models), since they tend to define at least subsystem-local architectural paradigms. (Ever tried restoring a huge RDBMS backup or performing a backup between major RDBMS versions where downtime is a concern? What about debugging interactions between numerous message queues, or disparate views of a shared database (eg. blockchain, split-capable orchestration systems) with supposed eventual consistency?)
6. Legal and regulatory considerations are often very powerful architectural concerns. In a multinational system with components owned by disparate legal entities in different jurisdictions, potential regulatory ingress (eg. halt/seize/shut down national operations) can become a significant consideration.
7. The new/greenfield systems design perspective is a valid and common one. However, equally commonly, established organizations' subsystems are (re-)designed/upgraded, and in this case system interfaces may be internal or otherwise highly distinct from public service design. Often these sorts of projects are harder because of downtime concerns, migration complexity and organizational/technical inertia.
